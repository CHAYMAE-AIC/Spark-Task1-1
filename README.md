Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn
In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.
\n
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
\n
1 - Importing all libraries required in this notebook
\n
2 - Plotting the distribution of scores
\n
3 - Preparing the data
\n
4 - Training the Algorithm
\n
5 - Plotting for the test data
\n
6 - Test with hours = 9.25
\n
PS : before starting the task I like to see some exemples of how to creat a graph using Seaborn and Matplotlib. Also how you can limit the data (show few data to work with)
